# Aristotle: Learn Smarter

The GitHub repo for the Aristotle dev team.

## Getting started:
Download Node.js from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) if you don't already have it.
Clone this repo to a folder in your local machine

## Create a branch for your changes
Run the command below with your tech id (i.e. sjoheron42) to create your branch in the repo

`git branch [techID]`

# Testing:
After you clone the repo, open a terminal in your VSCode session and split it (hit the nice little window pane button next to the +). I generally use the left terminal for my Node session and the right one for my Git stuff, but it's up to you.

Run `npm start` to test out your code in your browser. It will open a tab in your default browser (for the love of God don't use IE/Edge) to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000), which is where your app will defaultly live when you're running it. All of the routes found in App.js will just be extentions of that (i.e. [http://localhost:3000/contact](http://localhost:3000/contact))

# Merging:
After you've finished a ticket, [create a new pull request](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-pull-request). I will then go back, review your request, and merge if there are no conflicts. ***Make sure to test your changes thoroughly in your branch before creating a pull request.***
